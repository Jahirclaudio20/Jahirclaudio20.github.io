### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite of mine simply because it was my first ever lab programming assignment. I was able to compile and execute my first ever code. I was able to run the code Hello World!


* Lab 7 part 2

    Lab 7 part 2 was also a favorite of mine because I was able to write funcions that implement the parking restriction rules on signs. This code is interesting since it can be useful in a system that implements parking rules. 


* Lab 8 part 2
  
    Lab 8 part 2 was also a favorite lab of mine due to the reason that I was able to learn how to write a program that calcualtes the average of numbers given as command-line arguments.
